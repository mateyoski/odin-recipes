A A Odin's Project project that displays a website - practice.

This is an explanation to a project im undertaking about making a website and filling it with content.
The website will have recipes put together on things I don't know yet.
I'm certain I will have a greater knowledge of the whole of setting up a website, managing content in a proper manner, setting it up visually and being better at working from the command line as well as working with files and directories and how that translates to properly setting up a website.
