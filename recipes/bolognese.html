        <p>It is the most classic italian dish I could imagine, maybe besides pizza.
             It embodies the meatiness and tomatoes that in such great strength scream: italian.</p>
             <p> All it takes is a couple ingredients to enhance your basic tomato sauce to a proper <em>meat sauce</em> that the dish is supposed to be.</p> The ingredients are: carrot, celery, parmesan cheese, beef stock and red wine. The part that stays the same are tomatoes and minced meat. Let's get down to business.</p>
        <p> Ingredients
            <ul>
                <li>300g minced beef</li>
                <li>300g minced pork</li>
                <li>200g bacon(or guanciale if you have such delicacy on you)</li>
                <li>3 medium carrots</li>
                <li>3 celery sticks</li>
                <li>500ml of beef stock</li>
                <li>150ml red wine</li>
                <li>50g parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 medium white onions</li>
                <li>50g tomato paste</li>
                <li>300ml tomato passata</li>
                <li>a couple basil leaves</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>a couple cloves of garlic</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your vegetables: white onions in small cubes as well as carrots and celery</li>
                <li>Slice your bacon (or guanciale) into small cubes</li>
                <li>Pour oil into your pot - yes pot, you will need the capacity of a pot to fit it all (burner on medium-high heat), heat it up until it is warm and not smoking and behaves like water</li>
                <li>Toss in your vegetables, starting with onions and garlic until fragrant</li>
                <li>Remove your veggies once they are soft into a bowl</li>
                <li>It's time for bacon: set your burner to medium and make sure all the fat gets rendered and not burnt</li>
                <li>Once your bacon is browned, it's time for minced meat to come into the party: put both of beef and pork into the pot</li>
                <li>Stir everything often until meat starts to become grey/brown</li>
                <li>Toss in the veggies</li>
                <li>Put the tomato paste and passata into the pan</li>
                <li>Pour in the beef stock</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid</li>
                <li>Put the parmesan into the pot as a whole piece</li>
                <li>Stir occasionally until reduced and the meat sauce is thick</li>
                <li>Voila! You can prepare pasta for a proper pasta bolognese, or just eat straight out of the pot with a fork! (joking)</li>
