        <p>
            Carbonara is such a glorious meal that will pleasure your guests' and loved ones' palate.
            It is so simple to make yet the combination of fatty pancetta and sharp pecorino cheese 
            will make any mouth water with how complex the taste is.
            Considered an abomination by Italians when made with cream, proper carbonara has nothing
            of this sort.
            It simply uses a couple of techniques all pasta enjoyers and makers should know.
